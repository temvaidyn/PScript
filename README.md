# PirateScript 2022

JavaScript starter pack for the 'Pirate Script' assignment

## Task
- Open the file called `piratescript.js`
- Write a function that encodes a given input into pirate talk..
- For each word:
    - If the word is 'pounds', change this to pirate currency -> 'doubloons'
    - If the word is a number, leave this unchanged
    - Otherwise, take the first letter and move this to the end of the word and then add/append 'arr' to the end

### Example
```javascript
console.log( piratize( "hello" ) ); // returns "elloharr"

console.log( piratize( "hello world") ); // returns "elloharr orldwarr"

console.log( piratize( "pizza costs 20 pounds" ) ); // returns "izzaparr ostscarr 20 doubloons"
